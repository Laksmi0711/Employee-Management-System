# Employee-Management-System
Employee management system into a component-based architecture using the Spring Framework. 
Implemented core features such as employee CRUD, attendance tracking, leave management, performance evaluation, and group chat. 
Separated these features into independent Spring components to support better modularity, reusability, and maintainability. 
Enhanced the system with login access for both HR/Managers and Employees, including features like salary auto-calculation based on attendance, peer evaluation, and internal communication
